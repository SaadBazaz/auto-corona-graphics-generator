I had to tweak the World Map a bit - I manually named all 195 layers with their corresponding country names. This is necessary for any script to recognize a country. So if you require a **World Map with *properly named* layers**, you've come to the right place. You won't find it anywhere else on the internet.

> Am I the only one who names their layers?
